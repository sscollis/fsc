Compressible Falkner-Skan-Cooke solver

S. Collis

Here are some typical parameters for this code.

M_inf = 0.1, R=80000
lambda = 45 deg
BetaH = 1
Tw = 1, T0 = 1, muw = 1
T0/TN0 = 1.001
f'', g'
1.2332556981943E+00  5.7053820816947E-01


M_inf = 0.3, R=1000
lambda = 0
BetaH = 0
Tw = 1, T0=1, muw =1
f'', g' 
4.6959998836720E-01  4.6959998883669E-01

==================================================

Updated to build and run with gfortran on Darwin

to run a test problem simply build and then type

> ./fsc < test.inp

Note that one has to supply there own Runge routine
currently and I will provide an update removing this
dependancy shortly.

Also contains publically available software PPPack
from NetLib.org.
